Making your way around is becoming increasingly easy. Ask anyone who has intrepidly stuck out a hand in traffic to have at least two tuk-tuks veer to a halt. There’re even more digital options like Uber and PickMe for when your trip is slightly less impulsive. But what if you need to transport something that isn’t an inanimate object, human or otherwise? We’re here to tell you that now, there’s a web app for that and it’s called SendIT.

SendIT is a locally built web application which among other services, functions as an courier and logistics company. The concept for it has been around since 2016 and we have been active in various capacities since then.

## A Recap of SendIT’s Journey

By the mid part of 2018, the concept was fleshed out with a prototype and once seed funding was raised operations kicked off. Showing practically the vision you have for your idea was challenging.

We did a global study of the logistics industry to concoct a model which would work in both the local and global context. Eventually, Emmanuel Sindani of the Andela Fellowship saw potential in the venture.

We have since made it our mission to simplify access to the heavily fragmented transport industry in the country. Particularly in the business to business segment, ad-hoc delivery systems are nearing an expiration. For a country like ours which stocks over 300,000 lorries, 3 million bikes and a host of other potential means of delivery, a such an organization as ours we feel is in order.

## What does SendIT do, and why is it different?

You’ve made it to office by the skin of your teeth. You’ve left behind a project you worked on at home. As you watch your boss walking in, you realize there’s no way you can go back home to get it. Situations of this sort, among many others, are ideally when you could call on SendIT.

A glance at the SendIT website suggests that once you’ve signed-up as a customer, you need to set-up a pick-up and drop-off location for your delivery. After specifying the dimensions of the delivery, an appropriate transportation system is assigned and like taxi apps that flag your location, SendIT does the same. Each step of the way is tracked, “You get SMS notifications.”

Communication goes both ways, the cargo transporters can as well ring you if they’re struggling to navigate to your location. What makes SendIT an expedient option has much to do with how their deliveries work. “Nothing goes into holding”. Charging a flat rate for delivery within a 6-kilometer radius, all deliveries go from pickup straight to the delivery point. “So there is no room for error.”

Also on our buffet are business and merchant solutions like vehicle tracking and same-day-delivery to a potential client’s customers. How we manage this is because the small yet highly efficient team at SendIT is technologically driven. Grasping deeply the fact that tech is the foundation against which their services can be improved makes for much of the company’s ethos.


## Of potholes past and the road ahead

“As a culture, we never want to be complacent.” The reasoning here is simple, “You can’t be a crappy start-up in logistics.” This isn’t to say SendIT doesn’t have an agenda behind their hyper-efficiency. “Waiting 3-5 days for a delivery” isn’t acceptable anymore, we ask you to stop thinking of same-day or one-day deliver as a luxury.”

When it comes to feeding the urgency we’re generating, there’s a “chicken and egg” situation. The circularity of needing a bigger fleet to generate profit and vice-versa is problematic. With “a few 1000 downloads” of our app since February this year, however, the team is well on their way to a bigger fleet.

For now however, all SendIT’s energy is reserved to “get anything, anywhere, right.”
